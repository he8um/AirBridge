# Versioning

## Purpose

Use semantic versioning where practical. Pre-1.0 releases may introduce breaking changes, but breaking backup format changes must be documented clearly.

## Required release checks

- Changelog updated.
- Version updated.
- CI passing.
- Documentation reviewed.
- Known limitations reviewed.
- Build artifacts generated.
- Checksums generated.
- Release notes drafted.
